Yo whats up. Here are a few cool things you can do in the physics simulator

Left Click - spawn 10 balls
Left Click + g - change gravity
Left Click + backspace - delete balls

Right Click - suck in balls
Shift + Right Click - push away balls

Right/Left Arrows - change delta
Down Arrow - reset delta
Space - Pause Simulation(key inputs still work)
Backspace + shift - delete all balls

a - angles
e - spawn single ball
q/w - change ball size
r/t - change ball elasticity
p - reset velocity
c - see chunks
v - see vectors

s - see speed
d - see pressure

Just so you know, its not that hard to program your own rules and I suggest you give it a try. Ok have fun!
